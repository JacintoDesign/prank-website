# Prank Website

A tiny static prank website — simple HTML/CSS/JS in a single-page repo. This project contains a playful webpage intended for harmless pranks or experiments. It's an easy-to-run demo that requires no build tools.

## Project structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML page, entry point for the prank.
- `style.css` — Styles for the page.
- `script.js` — JavaScript that implements the prank behavior.

## How to run

The site is static. To open locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with...).

Or run a tiny local server (recommended if the prank uses modules or fetch):

## Notes & safety

- Ensure pranks are friendly and non-malicious. Don't use this project to trick or harm others, collect private data, or bypass security.
- If you plan to share or deploy the prank, get consent from participants and avoid content that could be embarrassing or dangerous.
